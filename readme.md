## Array-Sum Excercise
Project developed in NodeJS to show an algorithm proposed to solve the next exercise:

>The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.

```
> app 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4
```
## Installation and Setup Instructions
Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.
Installation:

`npm install`

To Run Test Suite:

`npm test`

To Start Server:

`node app`

## Reflection
I solved this exercise to show how I can solve the proposed exercise, also I wanted to add some possible Unit Test for this exercise, for the logic with 3 different examples with different quantity of outputs and for the reading file function, to test that the `resolve` value was returning the rigth type of value.
